\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2ex, itemsep=0ex]
\item[\mydot]
I am Assistant Research Professor at NAU, teaching and researching in sedimentology, sediment transport, geomorphology, hydroacoustics, and
scalable geocomputation. I often use machine learning tools in my research.

\item[\mydot]
Previously, I worked at the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, an
interdisciplinary program within the U.S. Geological Survey carrying out basic and applied research into sediment issues related to the management of regulated rivers in the Western United States.

\item[\mydot]
Previously I was an a post-doctoral fellow,
working in the Marine Science departments
at the University of Plymouth, and before that at the University of California Santa Cruz. During those fellowships, I worked on
sediment transport and hydrodynamics in nearshore and coastal shelf environments.

\item[\mydot]
My PhD research at the University of Plymouth (2004 - 2008) focused on the morphodynamics and sediment dynamics of macrotidal gravel beaches.

\item[\mydot]
I am interested in encouraging reproducible and open research practices
in geosciences.  To this end I spend significant time developing a variety of open-source
scientific computing tools.
